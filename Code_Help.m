%% Code Help

% You have three files of Matlab code to work with for your design project.
% You will need all three files in the same directory. This document will
% explain each of the files.


%% Notes

% You do not need to write any of the calls between the three different
% files. That is already done for you.

% Remember to rename your files in the following format:
% lastname_firstinitial_codename.m


%% Three files: run_sensorODE.m, sensorODE_solver.m, and sensorODE.m

% 1) run_sensorODE.m 
% MODIFY THIS FILE! 
% This script file holds your basic commands. Here is where you will set
% some initial conditions and change your antigen concentration. You can also
% turn on the chatter and stochasticity parameters to see how robust your
% system is. This is also where you will put all of your plotting commands.
% You will make a call (written for you) to the sensorODE_solver function
% to solve your system for you.

% 2) sensorODE_solver.m 
% DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE! 
% This function file holds the ODE solver that will take your system of
% ODEs from the sensorODE function and add noise to it.

% 3) sensorODE.m 
% MODIFY THIS FILE! 
% This function file holds your system of ODEs. Here you will set your
% parameters and initial conditions and define your ODE system.
